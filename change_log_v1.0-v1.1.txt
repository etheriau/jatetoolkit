# Change summary	#	
#########################
1. Added two more algorithms: Average corpus term frequency, RIDF
2. Changed method signitures in some classes; package nameings etc.

#########################
# Details		#
#########################

* package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.core.algorithm
Added Classes:
	AverageCorpusTFAlgorithm
	AverageCorpusTFFeatureWrapper
	RIDFAlgorithm
	RIDFFeatureWrapper

* package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.core.npextractor
Class: CandidateTermExtractor
	A number of methods are changed from "protected" to "public static"
	Method "protected String applyNPCharRemoval(String string)" now replaced by "public static String applyCharacterReplacement(String string, String pattern)"
	Method "public static String[] applyNPSplitList(String string)" now replaced by "public static String[] applySplitList(String string)"
	Method "protected String applyNPTrimStopwords(String in, StopList stop)" replaced by "public static String applyTrimStopwords(String string, StopList stop, Normalizer normalizer)"

Class: WordExtractor
	Added new variables to determine whether to remove stop words, or words that contain less than a minimum number of characters from the extracted words.
	Added a new constructor to allow setting the above variables
	

* package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate
Class: JATEProperties
	Variable "public static final String NP_FILTER_PATTERN = "[^a-zA-Z0-9\\-]" " replaced by "public static final String TERM_CLEAN_PATTERN = "[^a-zA-Z0-9\\-]" "
	Add variable "public static final String MULTITHREAD_COUNTER_NUMBERS", accesses the "jate.system.term.frequency.counter.multithread" variable in the property file.     
	Variable "public static final String TERM_CANONICAL_2_VARIANTS_MAPING = "jate.system.term.variant_mapping" deleted due to no-use


*package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.core.feature;
Deleted classes due to no-use:
	TermFreqCounterMultiThreadHelper
	TermFreqCounterThread
	

* "package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.debug" renamed to "package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.test"

* package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.test
Class: AlgorithmTester
	Method "public void execute(GlobalIndex index) throws JATEException, IOException" changed to "public void execute(GlobalIndex index, String outFolder) throws JATEException, IOException", to allow custom setting of output directory
	More comments added to provide detailed explanation	

Added Class: TestAverageCorpusTF
Added Class: TestRIDF

* package uk.ac.shef.dcs.oak.jate.util.counter
Class: TermFreqCounter
	Method "public int count(String context, Set<String> terms, boolean caseSensitive)" changed to "public int count(String context, Set<String> terms)". Counting is always case-sensitive. For case-insensitive counting, the input params should be pre-processed accordingly
